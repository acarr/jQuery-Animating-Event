Adds an 'animating' event to jQuery that is triggered during the element's animation.
Be warned that this plugin overides jQuery's fx.step._default method so we can fire
the event for every animation step. It calls the original jQuery method but there could
be issues if the method is every changed in future jQuery releases. Only tested with 
jQuery 1.4.3.
